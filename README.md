# ERC-20-mining-claim-contracts
# Mining and Token Contracts

tips appreciated Gooseverse.eth

This repository contains two Solidity smart contracts: a mining contract and a token contract. The mining contract allows users to mine tokens by spending Ethereum, and the token contract represents the tokens that users can claim.

## Mining Contract

The mining contract enables users to mine tokens by sending Ethereum transactions. It tracks the mined tokens, ensures the maximum supply limit is not exceeded, and allows the owner to end the mining process. The claimTokens function in this contract interacts with the Token Contract to allow users to claim their mined tokens.

### Usage

1. Deploy the Mining Contract on Ethereum.
2. Mine tokens by sending Ethereum transactions to the mine function.
3. The owner can end the mining process using the endMining function.
4. After the mining process ends, users can claim their tokens using the claimTokens function.

## Token Contract

The token contract is an ERC-20 token that users can claim after participating in the mining process. It initializes with a fixed supply, and the Mining Contract distributes tokens to users when they claim.

### Usage

1. Deploy the Token Contract on Ethereum.
2. The Mining Contract owner can distribute tokens to users by calling the distributeTokens function in the Token Contract.

## Deployment

1. Deploy the Token Contract.
2. Deploy the Mining Contract, providing the Token Contract's address.
3. Interact with the Mining Contract to mine tokens and end the mining process.
4. Users can claim their tokens after the mining process ends.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure proper testing and auditing before deploying contracts to the mainnet.
- Use secure practices for key management and contract deployment.
- Consider the implications of gas costs and efficiency for users.
